# Ember.js

Under the guidance of Lynda tutorial I manage to get an insight in Ember.js. Ember.js is a JavaScript framework for creating
robust, complex web apps wile writing very little code. Ember's attraction lies in its built-in template libary and rich 
feature set, which seems to grow almost every day. Understanding the core concepts behind Ember will help you use it now, no 
matter what enhancements are added in the future. 

In this project I learned about Ember's routers, templates, and models, and shows how to use templates to create simple
pages and dynamically load content using components and Ember Data.
